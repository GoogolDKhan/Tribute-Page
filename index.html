        <strong>Itachi Uchiha</strong>, age four. After seeing what occurs on
        the battlefield up close, he makes a certain decision. He decided that
        he would change the world. The dream that Itachi aimed for. His dream: A
        Hokage from the Uchiha clan, and a future where those he loved could
        live in peace. His time in the ninja academy, his meeting with Shisui,
        becoming a Genin, Chunin, and finally a member of the Anbu. Itachi ran
        straight down a path of glory, not knowing that a cruel darkness was
        spreading. This is the story of the glory, frustration, and
        determination of the ninja called a genius.

          People Live their Lives bound by what they accept as correct and true.
          That is how they define "Reality" . But what does it mean to be
          "correct" or "true"? They are merely vague concepts... Their "Reality"
          may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to be simply living in their
          own world, shaped by their beliefs?
